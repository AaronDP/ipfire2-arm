Subject: iwlagn: Fix build failure with CONFIG_IWLWIFI_DEBUG
References: bnc#551142
Patch-mainline: Never, replaced with pointer() %pM field

 This patch fixes a missing declaration of the mac address
 buffer. Since we don't build our release kernels with this
 option enabled, it doesn't fail our normal builds. I'm
 including it because the L3 and Desktop teams may need to use
 it to create test kernels while debugging wireless problems on SLED.
