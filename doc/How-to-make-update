Prerequisites
- have release right on sourceforge to be able to affect uploaded files to a release
- have 'IPCop development Group' private gpg key (and password) to sign the patch, import the key with gpg --import (private key file name)
- you can create your own key with whatever name you want and replace (temporarily!) the pub key in 
  your box (/root/.gnupg/*) for testing your patch

Build
- ./make.sh changelog and commit : update doc/Changelog (include in the .iso)
- ./make.sh build
- ./make.sh dist :
	build source package by exporting from CVS,
	create a check-list of modified files in doc/updated-sources.txt
- manually check all necessary files are include in updates/1.4.x/ROOTFILES.*.1.4.x comparing with /doc/updated-sources.txt
- sign the patch with gpg --local-user "IPCop Development Group" --sign ipcop-update-1.4.x.tgz (or with another name given to the key)
- for the announce, files md5 are obtained with md5sum ipcop-*

Sourceforge
- in case of test files, rename them with rename 1.4.x 1.4.xtest *1.4.x*
- upload files via ftp to upload.sourceforge.net in incoming directory
 (may need to have more than 30s inactivity timeout to be able to connect on sourceforge)
- add a new release
	for test file, status active under "IPCop test versions" package
	for official release, status active under "IPCop" package
	affect uploaded files (web interface Files Release System) on the release
	add Changelog and text abstract at the release
- control file size under Files web page once files are affected to the package
- with ssh, update every patch list on shell.sourceforge.net /home/groups/i/ip/ipcop/htdocs/patches preceding the previous v1.4.x version with :
	the content of updates/1.4x/information (and add the link to the release on sourceforge at the end of the line)
- add a new entry corresponding to the next version number in the patch list with only "----START LIST----" inside
  chmod 664 the file
- In Tracker, Tracker administration, bugs, add a new group corresponding to the version number

Update CVS :
- with the tag of the release
 cvs tag IPCOP_v1_4_(x)_FINAL

- bump VERSION and PREVIOUSTAG in make.sh
- ./make.sh newupdate
  will add a new directory in updates corresponding to the new version number with files:
	information (Id number should be 003 for VERSION=1.4.3)
	ROOTFILES.alpha-1.4.x
	ROOTFILES.i386-1.4.x
	setup
	.cvsignore (containing patch.tar.gz )
